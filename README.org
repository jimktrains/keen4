* keen4: A language for control systems

A means of defining constraints for use in control systems.

Ideally it'd be possible to write relativly complex discrete control systems
in a safe and sanity-perserving way. This means no manual memory managment,
no garbage collection, no unbounded operations beyond the main event loop,
constraints on memory, constraints on processing power, and hard-realtime
deadlines.

(N.B.: the goal of being able to work with hard-realtime deadlines means that
"constraints on processing power" does not mean "as fast as possible", but
"as fast as consistently possible".)

Please see [[weights.org]] for mor information about the progress and plans
of this project.
